## **Notes**

**History of Python**

-   Python was created in 1991 by Guido van Rossum.
-   Python 3 was released in 2008.
-   Specifically designed as an easy to use language, high focus on readability of code.
-   Clear logical code that is easy to read and learn.
-   Focuses on optimising developer time, rather than computer's processing time.
-   Base Python let's you write scripts and small programs.
-   Automate simple tasks like searching for files and editing them, scraping information from a website, read and write excel files, work with pdfs and automate emails etc.
-   Use Web frameworks such as Django and Flash to handle the backend or create interactive Dashboards for users.

**Python Installation**

-   To install Python, we will use the Anaconda distribution which includes Python as well as many other useful libs such as Jupyter.
-   There is also Miniconda, which is a smaller version of Anaconda.
-   Launch Anaconda Navigator.
-   Full Python IDE's are PyCharm and Spyder.
-   Jupyter Notebooks allow us to see our input and output next to each other. They support in-line markdown notes and visualizations. They're great for learning.
-   `.ipynb` stands for iPythonNotebook - you cannot open it using a normal IDE.
-   To run Python in the Terminal, run this command `python file_name.py`
-   If you're in an Python interpreter in Terminal, use `quit()` to exit.
