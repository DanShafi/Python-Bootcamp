**If, Elif & Else**

-   Mainly concerned in the need for **control flow**.
-   We use these statements when we only want certain code to execute in a program that execugtes when a particular condition has been met.
-   Control flow syntax makes use of colons and indentation. This indentation system is crucial to Python and unique to the language.
